# The Adventure of Little Atom

This game made for a Game Jam(Magara Jam #3) within 72 hours with 3 member team. For the Game Jam theme was "System failure". We used system as a ocean ecosystem and a failure as a big fish eats smaller fishes. In our game, ecosystem turns upside down and small fish starts to eat bigger fish, however since we get bigger as we eat more fish our enemies are growing.
